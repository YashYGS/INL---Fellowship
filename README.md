Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF), Purdue â€“ ML Algorithm and Software Developer

The following is more context to this project
- Developed an interactive masking and training web application for Idaho National Labs, and integrated ML algorithms into the application that converts sensitive nuclear data into secure data for researchers to collaborate on, to ensure secure AI/ML research in the nuclear domain.  
- Used Python Django framework for the web interface, developed multiple pages and used ML libraries such as Sklearn, Numpy for the embedded masking and training algorithms. Focused on data privacy and security through ML models. 
- Developed custom features that would enable users/Scientists to experiment with the training algorithm (eg: Change the number of Epochs), and displayed the real-time efficiency impact of the change through plots.  
- Worked on training algorithms with Nuclear Engineering Researchers and integrated them into the application (Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Conducted research on Proving or Disproving invertibility of matrices with neural networks by rigorous training and testing.
- Abstract published in Purdue's Summer Research Conference.https://www.purdue.edu/undergradresearch/conferences/summer/archive/AbstractBooklet_Summer2023.pdf (Page 378)
- The programming files in this repository, contain parts my code used to create this applcaition as certain specific files and functions related to data masking cannot be disclosed.
